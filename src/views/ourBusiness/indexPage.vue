        <p>
          Across Africa, there is a desperate need for power. To combat this
          issue, countries across the continent are partnering with Independent
          Power Producers (IPP) to produce power to make up for energy
          shortfall.
        </p>
        <p>
          At ASHFAR , we have made it our goal to be at the forefront of
          generating electricity using renewable sources. We are investing in
          technologies that make renewable energy more affordable and
          accessible. We have set high targets to maximize the use of the
          abundant sunlight by deploying the latest in solar power generation
          technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also emphasize on the use of advanced Battery Energy Storage
          Systems (BESS) that facilitate a 24-hour cycle in solar power
          generation. To enhance our sustainability drive across the power
          value-chain, we also work with utility and industry customers to
          improve their performance while lowering environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          We build high voltage, medium voltage and low voltage power
          substations and we enlists Original Equipment Manufacturers such as
          ABB, SIEMENS and Emerson for our procurement needs.
